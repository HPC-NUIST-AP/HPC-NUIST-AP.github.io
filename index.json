Most of the HPC compute nodes have 24 CPU cores so if you are unsure of how many cores you are using per node, 24 is a good estimate.\nConcurrent Job Limits In general, jobs will be scheduled and run on a first-come, first-served basis within a partition, provided that adequate resources are available. To maximize the use of computing resources, HPC management, in consultation with the HPC allocation committee, may restrict the number of jobs you can run concurrently from a given account.\nGeneral Partition Rules    Partition Name Maximum Jobs Queued Maximum Node Count Maximum Wall Time Maximum Jobs per User     low       high       Addnode       zhao        Disk Space    Root of home directory Quota     /pulic/home/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; 300 G   /public1/home/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; 1.5 T   /datadir1/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; 2.5 T    Please check your home directory by echo $HOME and check used disk space by du -sh $HOME.\n If used space is larger than quota, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t store files anymore and need to delete some files.\n "
