For **students**, all student accounts are closed and files are **deleted at the deadline** filled in the [application form](https://hpc-nuist-ap.github.io/account/application/application-1/).

For **teachers**, usersâ€™ accounts **are not automatically deactivated** upon termination of an employee because many people change their employment status.

The **administrator** of HPC is ultimately responsible for notifying users when user accounts should be closed, and to specify the disposition of a user's files and data.
