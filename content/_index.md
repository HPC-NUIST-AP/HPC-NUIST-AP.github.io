# About

In recognition of the increasing importance of research computing across many disciplines, *School of Atmospheric Physics (AP), NUIST* has made a significant investment in developing the **High Performance Computing** service, as a way to grow and sustain high performance computing.

This service is intended to provide AP's campus researchers with state-of-the-art, professionally-administered computing systems and ancillary infrastructure.

## Mission

Our mission is to deliver reliable, sustainable computing resources and services to meet the computational research demands of the AP community: address fundamental problems in research and engineering that require computation. Examples of these problems include global climate modeling, cloud modeling, weather forecast, air quality forecast, and many more.

## People

This service is supported by a collaboration with the teachers at AP.
