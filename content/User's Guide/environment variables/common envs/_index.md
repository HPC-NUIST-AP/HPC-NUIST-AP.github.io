Here're some common environment variables:

| Variable            | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PATH**            | This variable contains a colon (:)-separated list of directories in which your system looks for executable files. <br>When you enter a command on terminal, the shell looks for the command in different directories mentioned in the $PATH variable. <br>If the command is found, it executes. Otherwise, it returns with an error 'command not found'. |
