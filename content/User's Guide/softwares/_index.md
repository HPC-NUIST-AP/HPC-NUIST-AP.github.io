HPC maintains software, compilers, and libraries in the directory `/public/software` and `/datadir1/software`.

To access much of the software available on the AP cluster - ranging from compilers and interpreters to statistical analysis and visualization software, and much more - you'll need to set **ENVs by yourself** according to the [Load](https://hpc-nuist-ap.github.io/users-guide/softwares/load/) section.

We'll use [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) to manage softwares soon. It'll be much easier and more convenient ... <br> Anyway, it's better to understand ENVs before using `module`.
