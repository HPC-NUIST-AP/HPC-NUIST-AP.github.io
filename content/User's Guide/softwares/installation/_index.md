In addition to the software provided on the cluster, you are welcome to install your own software.

Before installing software yourself, first check **if it is already provided on the cluster**.

If you are installing software exclusively for your use, you can install it in your Home directory (`/public/home/<username>`).

If you will be doing a lot of software installation, you may want to **add sub-directories** for *sources* (source files downloaded), *softwares* (the installed software), *scripts* (if you want to document and routinize your installation process using a script -- which is recommended).

In any case, be cognizant of space limitations in your Home directory (see [quota](https://hpc-nuist-ap.github.io/overview/resource-limits/#disk-space)).
